# flask-biodata-app
This is a simple walkthrough app that introduces my private students to Python web programming using the Flask framework. The app is designed to allow the user (students) to create a profile and submit their biodata records to the school authority.

In the course of the project we will do the following:
1. Set up a project folder
2. Set up a virtual environment to host all our project specific libraries
3. Set up the app factory function
4. Set up a database and other related Models to store the biodata records
5. Set up a database migration script to create the database and tables
6. Set up the View controllers to handle the user interface
7. Set up the view templates to render the user interface
8. Optionally, set up a test suite to test the app
